Hello fellow humans! I'm Aghila, an undergraduate student in Physics with an immense passion for technology. My heart resides in the unending cosmos and in the mind-boggling multiverse of quantum phenomena. Every small step I make, every book I read, every lecture I listen to, every tech I learn, I am allowing myself to understand more and more about the Universe and its beings. I gotta tell I'm really enjoying it too! I believe this is a platform which can help all of us to create, collaborate and aspire each others to make everyone's life better. Afterall, "UNDER THE SKY, UNDER THE HEAVENS, THERE IS BUT ONE FAMILY"
